							<p>I have dedicated my career to helping patients suffering from ADHD and ASD.  I am seeking your help in joining me to help those suffering from ADHD and ASD.</p>
								
							<p>I will continue to invest my personal funds to defend what I believe in. I am proud to say that I put my money where my mouth is, and I have invested over US$9 million in my company(US$3.2 million in IPO shares and US$5.9 million through open market stock purchases) to demonstrate my personal belief and commitment.</p>

							<h2>My struggles with ADHD and ASD</h2>
							<p>I grew up with ADHD and ASD, and myearly life was extremely difficult. I was also dyslexic, could not sit still,had difficulties writing, spelling and pronouncing words, couldn’t do simplemathematics and had other learning disabilities. Coupled with an uncontrollabletemper, I was an outcast in school. I regularly went to speech therapy becauseI had trouble speaking and no one could understand me. In middle school, Ireceived mostly Ds on my report cards. I was devastated. Since my brothers werestraight A students, I was the black sheep in my family. I started high school in the bottom 1% and had to spend more hours every day studying than other students without my conditions.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Eventually, I graduated in the top2% and was accepted to UC Berkeley, and with continued determination, I was subsequently accepted into Haas School of Business. I wrote about determination in my college application essay. My friends and even my family couldn’t believe that I actually got into a top college. Therefore, if someone tells you that you can’t do something or you are not good enough, it’s up to you to prove them wrong. Always believe in yourself and never give up. Perseverance and determination are the keys to success. Through my own personal experience and understanding of the daily challenges and difficulties of having ADHD and ASD,I founded RGC, a company devoted to the R&D and commercialization of traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”) for the treatment of  ADHD and ASD, to save and improve lives.</p>

							<h2>Seeing is believing</h2>
							<p>Over the years, I have witnessed many amazing improvements and results from thetreatment. To name but a few:</p>

							<p>A10-year-old boy who had severe cognitive impairment and needed instructions asto when and how to use the bathroom: He had a habit of tearing paper money forno reason because he didn't understand and was not able to learn the concept ofpaper currency. After the treatment, he was able to use the toilet by himself,understood what paper money was and would save it to buy things, andalsostarted learning and remembering. When his mother retold the story, shecouldn’t help but shed happy tears. Even his teachers were impressed with hisimprovement.

							</p>

							<p>A6-year-old boy who always ignored his father and showed little affectiontowards his mother: After treatment, one day out of the blue, he startedtalking to his father and called his mother “good mummy,” showing his affectionfor her. His parents were speechless about his progress and excited to see himget better.

							</p>

							<p>A9-year-old boy who could not speak due to his autistic condition: After a fewmonths of treatment, he was able to say ‘mommy, I love you’ for the first time.His mother was so happy and thankful that she was overwhelmed with tears of joywhen she retold the moment. Another boy who had a pattern of being physicallyviolent towards his mother: He had an uncontrollable temper and would oftenstrangle his mother. She was so fearful that she called the police on manyoccasions. After receiving treatment, he no longer exhibits uncontrollableaggressive behavior. He now works, lives a normal life and contributes to thesociety and his parents.

							<h2 style="color: #303030;">I was also a patient MYSELF</h2>
							<p style="color: #303030;">I was very fortunate that the sameTCM treatment was available to me, and I’ve been taking it for over 30 years.It has helped improve my ADHD and ASD conditions.
							</p>

							<p style="color: #303030;">But that’s not all; the TCM treatments also helped me in other ways. In March2017, I tore my ACL and my MRI showed severe collateral damage around the ACL.I visited over 20 doctors in Hong Kong and the US. All the best doctors in theworld told me that I could never ski again and needed to undergo surgeryimmediately. After taking a customized course of the TCM treatment and followedup with an MRI in February 2018, my doctor told me that the collateral damagein my knee was no longer present and I could ski again. After this positive diagnosis, I immediatelybooked my ski trip and skied for a month, andcontinued to do that for the next 3 years.


							</p>

							<p style="color: #303030;">I contracted COVID in 2022. Instead of hoping for the best and waiting forrecovery, I took the TCM formula for COVID and fully recovered in a shortperiod of time.
							</p>

							<p style="color: #303030;">Why do I continue to invest in andremain 100% committed to the TCM treatment? My answer is simple: seeing isbelieving. The goal of RGC’s natural TCM formula is to save and improve lives.However, I need your support to bring this treatment to the next level so thatit can be made available to anyone anywhere.
