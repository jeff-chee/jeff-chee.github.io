To date, I’ve helped thousands of families, individuals and organizations in Hong Kong, the US, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines by providing grants and giving gifts through Regencell Foundation, RGC’s philanthropic arm. Regencell Foundation’s goal is to provide relief and support to children with ADHD/ASD and elderly people who are in financial distress. If you want to know more about the details of the grants, gifts and all the other charitable initiatives we’ve done, please visit our <a class="text-orange" href="https://www.regencellbioscience.com/regencell-foundation/" target="_blank">website</a> under the “Regencell Foundation” tab.</p>

                <br>

                <p class="content-text">I will continue to invest my personal funds to defend what I believe in. I am proud to say that I put my money where my mouth is, and I have invested over US$9 million in my company (US$3.2 million in IPO shares and US$5.9 million through open market stock purchases), to demonstrate my personal belief and commitment.</p>

                                <p class="content-text">I grew up with ADHD and ASD, and my early life was extremely difficult. I was also dyslexic, could not sit still, had difficulties writing, spelling and pronouncing words, could not do simple mathematics and had other learning disabilities. Coupled with an uncontrollable temper, I was an outcast in school. I regularly went to speech therapy because I had trouble speaking and no one could understand me. In middle school, I received mostly D's on my report cards. I was devastated. Since my brothers were straight A students, I was the black sheep in my family. I started high school in the bottom 1% and had to spend more hours every day studying than other students without my conditions.</p>

I wrote about determination in my college application essay. My friends and even my family couldn’t believe that I actually got into a top college. Therefore, if someone tells you that you can’t do something or you are not good enough, it is up to you to prove them wrong. Always believe in yourself and never give up. Perseverance and determination are the keys to success. Through my own personal experience and understanding of the daily challenges and difficulties of having ADHD and ASD, I founded RGC, a company devoted to the R&D and commercialization of traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”) for the treatment of ADHD and ASD, to <a class="text-orange" href="https://www.benzinga.com/general/biotech/22/11/29658800/from-providing-grants-to-over-10-000-children-with-adhd-asd-and-covid-19-to-building-a-company-to" target="_blank">save and improve lives</a>.</p>

                            <p class="content-text text-center">Over the years, I have witnessed many amazing improvements and results from the treatment. To name but a few:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="content-text content-box">A 10-year-old boy who had severe cognitive impairment and needed instructions as to when and how to use the bathroom: He had a habit of tearing paper money for no reason because he didn't understand and was not able to learn the concept of paper currency. After the treatment, he was able to use the toilet by himself, understood what paper money was and would save it to buy things, and also started learning and remembering. When his mother retold the story, she couldn’t help but shed happy tears. Even his teachers were impressed with his improvement.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="content-text content-box">A 6-year-old boy who always ignored his father and showed little affection towards his mother: After treatment, one day out of the blue, he started talking to his father and called his mother “good mummy,” showing his affection for her. His parents were speechless about his progress and excited to see him get better.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="content-text content-box">A 9-year-old boy who could not speak due to his autistic condition: After a few months of treatment, he was able to say ‘mommy, I love you’ for the first time. His mother was so happy and thankful that she was overwhelmed with tear of joy when she retold the moment.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="content-text content-box">Another boy who had a pattern of being physically violent towards his mother: He had an uncontrollable temper and would often strangle his mother. She was so fearful that she called the police on many occasions. After receiving treatment, he no longer exhibits uncontrollable aggressive behavior. He now works, lives a normal life and contributes to the society and his parents.</p>

                <p class="content-text">I was very fortunate that the same TCM treatment was available to me, and I’ve been taking it for over 30 years. It has helped improve my ADHD and ASD conditions.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="content-text">But that’s not all; the TCM treatments also helped me in other ways. In March 2017, I tore my ACL and my MRI showed severe collateral damage around the ACL. I visited over 20 doctors in Hong Kong and the US. All the best doctors in the world told me that I could never ski again and needed to undergo surgery immediately. After taking a customized course of the TCM treatment and followed up with an MRI in February 2018, my doctor told me that the collateral damage in my knee was no longer present and I could ski again. After this positive diagnosis, I immediately booked my ski trip and skied for a month, and continued to do that for the next 3 years.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="content-text">I contracted COVID in 2022. Instead of hoping for the best and waiting for recovery, I took the TCM formula for COVID and fully recovered in a short period of time.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="content-text">Why do I continue to invest in and remain 100% committed to the TCM treatment? My answer is simple: seeing is believing. The goal of RGC’s natural TCM formula is to save and improve lives. However, I need your support to bring this treatment to the next level so that it can be made available to anyone anywhere.</p>
