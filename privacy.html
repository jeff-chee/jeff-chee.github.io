If you continue to use this site we will assume that you are happy with it.</p><p>PRIVACY POLICY</p><p>Regencell Foundation respects the privacy of visitors to its website, and we recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of personally identifiable information you share with us (any information by which you can be identified, including your first and last name, and email address, phone number or other contact information). This policy describes how we collect and use information about visitors to this website. By visiting the Regencell Foundation website or otherwise submitting your personal information to us, you acknowledge and consent to our practices described below.</p><p>IF YOU REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION, YOU WILL ENSURE THAT EACH MEMBER OF YOUR ORGANIZATION (INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS) ABOUT WHOM PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROVIDED TO REGENCELL FOUNDATION HAS GIVEN HIS OR HER EXPRESS CONSENT TO REGENCELL FOUNDATION PROCESSING OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION.</p><p>You may use our website without disclosing to us any personally identifiable information.</p><p>We collect personally identifiable information about you only if you choose to provide it to us, such as through this website, through our customer service telephone system and through communications with us. For example, we collect personally identifiable information you submit through this website when you shop, or request a quote, or contact us via the “Contact Us” area of our site. In all cases, we collect, store or use your personally identifiable information when it is voluntarily submitted to us. You may choose not to submit such information. If you choose not to provide certain information, you may be unable to receive certain services or information.</p><p>We do not use browser cookies to track user behavior on our website. Although our web server does log certain technical information automatically, such as the identity of your Internet Service Provider and your computer’s IP address, none of this technical information reveals your identity to us, and it is not associated with any personally identifiable information you may choose to provide.</p><p>Any email messages and associated information that you send to addresses published on this website are not governed by this policy.</p><p>Use &amp; Disclosure of Information. We track certain information about our website, such as the total number of visitors to our site, the number of visitors to each page of our site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. We analyze this website data for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous.</p><p>When you do provide personally identifiable information to us, we may use it in the following ways. We may use your information to respond to requests you may make of us, to process orders, to contact you, and to provide information to you about our company or our products. We also may use your personal information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and our business.</p><p>Regencell Foundation uses third parties (including contactors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of our operations, which may require disclosure or your personal information to them. For example, we may use a third party to maintain and host our website and related databases, to process and collect payment via your credit card (if applicable), and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. These companies may have access to personal information you submit to our site, but we contractually limit their ability to re-use or re-disclose it.</p><p>We may disclose your personally identifiable information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing that information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or other laws, or if we reasonably believe we are required by law to disclose it.</p><p>We may share some or all of your personal information with any current or future “affiliate” (which means a parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, or other company under common control with Regencell Foundation), in which case we will require the affiliate to honor this privacy policy. If Regencell Foundation should ever file for bankruptcy, undergo reorganization, be acquired by or merge with another company, or divest a portion of its business, then we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the successor for the related business. Any and all uses of your information will comply with applicable laws.</p><p>Additional Information. This site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect information about an individual’s age.</p><p>Changing Your Information. If you have been receiving information from us and no longer wish to do so, please contact us and let us know. Please note that if you previously authorized us to provide the information to identified third parties, you will need to contact them regarding use of your information.</p><p>Changes to this Policy. This policy is effective January 1, 2018. We may change this policy at any time, based on the needs of our business or the evolution of our website. Any material changes to the policy will be published on this website. By your continued use of the website, you consent to the terms of the revised policy.</p><p>Links to Other Websites. This website may link to websites maintained by third parties. Please be aware that these third-party websites are governed by their own privacy policies and do not fall within this policy. We are not responsible for the content or policies maintained by these websites. Please familiarize yourself with the privacy policy of any third-party website you visit, as it will govern any information you submit through that website.</p><p>Security of Your Information. We take reasonable steps to protect personal information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, you should know that no company, including Regencell Foundation, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.</p><p>Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to other third parties. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p><p><br><br></p><p><br></p></div></div></div>
